## Data Model

The application loads its data from `public/products.json`, which contains an array of service objects. Each service has fields such as:

- `title`: Human-readable name of the service/product
- `id`, `sku`: Unique identifiers
- `product`: Product family or type
- `category`: Service category (e.g., Compute, Storage, Database)
- `region`: Deployment region
- `maturityModelState`: Maturity level (e.g., beta, ga)
- `price`, `monthlyPrice`: Pricing information (string, in â‚¬)
- `attributes`: Nested object with technical details (e.g., `vCPU`, `ram`)
- `unit`, `unitBilling`, `currency`, `generalProductGroup`, etc.

**Note:** The data model is extensible and may include additional fields depending on the product.

## Usage

- **Search:** Use the search bar to find services by any keyword.
- **Filter:** Use the filter panel to narrow down results by product, category, region, maturity, CPU, or RAM.
- **Sort:** Click on table headers to sort by any column.
- **Pagination:** Adjust entries per page and navigate between pages.
- **Export:** Click the "Export CSV" button to download the current view as a CSV file.
